// ArchiveSearchRange A range is request criteria for the search operation applicable for the data types like date, datetime and integers. Range can be specified either by providing the 'from' and 'to' field or the 'since' field.For example to find   1. Search the transactional events generated in between 2020-04-01 (April 1, 2020) and 2020-05-31 (May 31, 2020), we can use {"attributeName" : "creationDate", "range" : {"from" : "2020-04-01", "to" : "2020-05-31"}}.   2. Search the transactional events where the request data size in between 1000 and 4000 - {"attributeName" : "apiName", "range" : {"from" : 1000, "to" : 4000}}.

type ArchiveSearchRange struct {
	From  *interface{} `json:"from" form:"name=from,json"` // from value is used to set the minimum value in the request criteria and it can be integer, date or datetime
	Since *string      `json:"since" form:"name=since"`    // This field is to search the data for the last few duration in units like seconds, minutes, hours, days and weeks. Possible units are [smhdw]
	To    *interface{} `json:"to" form:"name=to,json"`     // to value is used to set the maximum value in the request criteria and it can be integer, date or datetime
}
