// PolicyMgmtEnforcementValIDAtionMessage This model is used to give the details about conflicts between the policy enforcements. The conflicts may arise due to dependent policy action enforcement missing or due to occurrence or due to mutually exclusive policy enforcements. These happen during the below scenarios  1. When a policy is attached to an API, the enforcement validation will happen on policy. 2. When a global policy is getting activated, it will validate the policy enforcement of the corresponding global policy and the runtime policy enforcements on the applicable APIs for any violation.

type PolicyMgmtEnforcementValIDAtionMessage struct {
	APIId           *string                                    `json:"apiId" form:"name=apiId"`           // ID of the API which is having the policy enforcement violation
	APIName         *string                                    `json:"apiName" form:"name=apiName"`       // Name of the API which is having the policy enforcement violation
	APIType         *string                                    `json:"apiType" form:"name=apiType"`       // Type of the API which is having the policy enforcement violation
	APIVersion      *string                                    `json:"apiVersion" form:"name=apiVersion"` // Version of the API which is having the policy enforcement violation
	ErrorOnResource []*PolicyMgmtResourcePolicyValIDAtionError `json:"errorOnResource" form:"name=errorOnResource,json"`
