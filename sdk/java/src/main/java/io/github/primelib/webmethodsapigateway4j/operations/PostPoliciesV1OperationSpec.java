/**
 * PostPoliciesV1
 * <p>
 * This REST request is used to create a policy in API Gateway. The body of this request should contain the payload of the policy. Using this request we can create Policies of different type.
 *  To create a service, scope, package and template level policy we can add the policy payload and set the corresponding policy scope. 
 * To create a Global policy user should have API Gateway Administrator access. Other users cannot create global policies. To Create Global policy send the policy payload along with scope details and policy scope set to global. Similarly, to create a threat protection policy user have to send the policy along with the policy enforcement id of Threat protection policy actions. The policy actions needs to be created before adding the enforcement id of policy actions to policy. Threat protection rules are another type of global level policies which are applied to all requests and responses. The threat protection policy enforcement cannot be used in any other policies and other policy enforcement cannot be used in threat protection policies.
 *  Using this request we can also clone a policy. To clone a policy user have to set the appropriate query parameters.
 *  The effective policy calculation for policy(Service and scope level policy) is not calculated till it is referred in the API. But for a  global policy the effective policy is calculated while creating the policy itself. Policy with template as policy scope cannot be referred from any API or scope. User needs to clone the policy templates and set the policy scope to either service or scope or global before referring it from the API. Policy should have only one occurrence of any stage. Multiple policy enforcements can be added to the applicable stages. To know about the list of stages and applicable policy enforcements on that stage please refer /policyStages resource.
